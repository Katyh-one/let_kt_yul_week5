Have you achieved this differently:
> Understanding the use of the different files
> Logic of the winner - good way of doing it by Yulianna and Leticia to have draw first then player win and then computer outcome is rest

Does anyones solution stand out:
> Leticia use of slice is very clever to get the computer output to match scissors
> Getting a written match report

How would you structure your code differently 
DRY - repeatable code/ reusable code

Would you consider changing the names of your variables or functions?
